  I guess you could say this is where Trails We Hike was born.  Jeremy and I had been camping separately in July and August of 2016 and Jeremy had still not made it out to my family cabin in Utah. I had just returned from there, but my birthday was coming up and had a 3-day weekend planned. All I really wanted to do was be back in the Uintas, so at the last minute, Jeremy and I decided to drive back to Utah and take in one last trip of the summer.
  
  Luckily for Jeremy and me, we enjoy road trips. After driving from the Bay Area to Philadelphia (and then back a year later) when we were 21, 10 hours just isnâ€™t that bad.  Plus, the road, at least for us, is part of the trip. Our 3rd passenger on the search for that endless hike.
  
  After watching Mile... Mile and a Half (again) and countless reruns of Adventure Archives in between their new releases, we took that inspiration, loaded up the truck with video gear and set out to capture a 2 day hike from Bald Mountain to the Crystal Lake Trail Head in the High Uintas.  
  
  Fully aware of our ignorance, we initially had intended for this to simply be a learning experience and perhaps get a couple shots for personal use, but we were happier than expected at the end of the process and have decided to share it here with you.  Please enjoy as you follow along with us on the Trails We Hike!
