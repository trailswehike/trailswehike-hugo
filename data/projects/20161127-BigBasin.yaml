  As I had mentioned in the previous release, we were renting some different camera and lens combinations (the first 2 of which resulted in our 5-minute Trails We Hike episode at Castle Rock) before deciding on what we were going to purchase and our last test set had arrived. It was a beautiful day, so we grabbed our families and some friends and headed out to Big Basin.

  I think the goal of this hike was to balance the efforts of trying to get as much footage as we could while not driving everyone else we brought insane with the stop, starts and restarts. When youâ€™re used to just hiking, it can be a little different when you have two morons following after you and asking if you could take that bend just one more time.

  With that in mind, we decided to take the Sunset-Skyline Short Loop, giving us options to use Middle Ridge Road to shorten the hike, if needed, as well as providing us with some different looks that Big Basin has to offer. Please enjoy as you follow along with us on the Trails We Hike!
