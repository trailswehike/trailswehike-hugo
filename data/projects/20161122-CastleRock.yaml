  After catching the video bug once we returned from Utah, we knew this is something that we wanted to continue to do. However, only having a GoPro and iPhone to take video with, it was obvious that it was time to get a real camera. But which one?
  
  We had mapped out a couple different paths and decided to rent some camera and lens combos and just start shooting. Once the first rentals showed up, we headed out to one of the closest state parks near us, Castle Rock.

  Usually when heading up to Castle Rock, we would be going to Castle Rock itself to do some fantastic bouldering and/or rock climbing, but we wanted to try and see if we couldnâ€™t get a some shots of the sunset and the best place to do so would be either at Castle Rock Falls or Goat Rock. 

  Along the way, we decided to shoot the hike as well and try to do some comparisons between the two camera and lens combos.  Once returned, we realized we had enough footage to put together a short 5 minute Trails We Hike video and have shared that here.  Please enjoy as you follow along with us on the Trails We Hike!
